        <h2>Marks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Areas denote the states.</li>
          <li>A line denotes the total electoral college votes.</li>
          <li>A point denotes the winning threshold on the line.</li>
          <li>Points denote the electoral votes of Nebraska and Maine.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Color for the party that would win the state, or striped of the state is divided. This
            is a good choice because color clearly shows the distribution of two possible major
            parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Length of color on the line based on amount of electoral votes the party would get. This
            is a good choice because it clearly indicates the margin that either candidate won by.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shape for the triangle denotes winning threshold on line. This is an ok choice. A
            vertical line would have been a more clear indicator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shape for the squares represents electoral votes. This is a good choice because it's a
            relatively simple shape.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Categorical red and blue colormap indicating red for Republican and blue for Democrat.
            Again, this is a good choice because the two colors clearly indicate the two major USA
            political parties.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Marks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Points denote batted balls.</li>
          <li>Lines classify angles.</li>
          <li>Lines indicate scoring values as a legend.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Color denotes the scoring value of the ball. This is a good choice because a spectrum of
            color directs the eye towards extremes of note.
          </li>
          <li>
            Position denotes the launch angle and the exit velocity. This is a good choice because
            it clearly maps batted in relation to each other based on two variables in an x-y
            coordinate plane.
          </li>
          <li>
            Position denotes the threshold for classifying angles (e.g. groundballs below 10
            degrees. This is a good choice because the y intercept of the horizontal lines clearly
            divides the lanuch angles into an "above" and "below" category.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Divergent purple to orange colormap indicates below average for purple, average for
            white, and above average for orange. This is a good choice because divergent colormaps
            allow for comparison of magnitudes above or below and average
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Marks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Points represent movies.</li>
          <li>A line indcates the box office revenue as a legend.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Position of points (movies) represent their IMDB and metacritic scores. This is a good
            choice because it cleary indicates how a movie scores.
          </li>
          <li>
            Color of the points (movies) represent the revenue generated for a movie. This is a good
            choice because it draws the viewers eyes towards notable points.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Divergent white to green colormap indicates the revenue generated for a movie. The
            darker shades of green represent higher revenue movies. This is a good choice because
            divergent colormaps allow for comparison of magnitudes and clearly indicate points of
            interest.
